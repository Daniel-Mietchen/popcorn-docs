# cue( time, callback ) #

## Purpose ##

`cue()` is a preferred alias to `exec()`.

`cue()` was created with film makers in mind by using a familiar keyword in order to make developing Popcorn.js projects simpler.

## Options ##

* `**time**` - the time in which the cue will be fired at
* `**callback**` - a callback function that will be executed at the given `**time**`

## Use Cases ##

* Perform an action at some point in the video
* Unique functionality that is not big enough to warrant a plugin

## Example ##

* Log data at points in the video [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/popcornjs/a38mA/)
