* **onStart** \[Function\] - the function to be run when the start time is reached.
* **onFrame** \[Function\] - a function to be run on each paint call (e.g., called ~60 times per second) between the start and end times.

{% highlight js linenos %}
    var pop = Popcorn( "#video" );

    pop.code({
      start: 1,
      end: 3,
      onStart: function( options ) {
        document.getElementById( "test1" ).innerHTML = "Yes";
      },
      onEnd: function( options ) {
        document.getElementById( "test1" ).innerHTML = "No";
