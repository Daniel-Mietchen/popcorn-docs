# First time using Popcorn.js #

## What is Popcorn.js? ##

Popcorn.js is a JavaScript library that allows video, audio and other media to control and be controlled by arbitrary elements of a webpage. Combining open source web technologies, authors can let their media be the “conductor” of interactive and immersive experiences.

While no prior HTML or JavaScript experience and knowledge is necessary &mdash; it is helpful and will make the process of creating your first Popcorn experience easier.

To get started, you'll first include the Popcorn.js script in a basic HTML file &mdash; you may use just the core or the fully loaded Popcorn.js (includes modules, effects, plugins, players, parsers, etc). Alternatively, you can create your own Popcorn.js script using [build tool](http://mozillapopcorn.org/build-tool/).

Including the script is simple, take a look:

{% highlight html linenos %}
  <html>
    <head>
      <script src="http://popcornjs.org/code/dist/popcorn-complete.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
  </html>
{% endhighlight %}

Note: All Popcorn.js code is available in both production (minified) and development (source) form, these can be found on the [downloads page](http://mozillapopcorn.org/popcornjs/).

Next, you'll add a video (or audio) to your page - this example will use an HTML5 video (Popcorn.js also works with YouTube and Vimeo). Building on the previous example, add your video markup as shown below:

{% highlight html linenos %}
  <html>
    <head>
      <script src="http://popcornjs.org/code/dist/popcorn-complete.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <video height="180" width="300" id="ourvideo">
        <source src="http://videos.mozilla.org/serv/webmademovies/popcornplug.mp4">
        <source src="http://videos.mozilla.org/serv/webmademovies/popcornplug.ogv">
        <source src="http://videos.mozilla.org/serv/webmademovies/popcornplug.webm">
      </video>
      <div id="footnote"></div>
    </body>
  </html>
{% endhighlight %}

We created a video element with an id of "ourvideo".  We will need this id later in order to tell Popcorn which video we are going to be using. After this we added 3 sources to the video.  We added a .mp4, .ogv, and .webm version of our video in order to make sure that the video will work across all current browsers.  Keep in mind that the .mp4 version needs to be included first if the video is going to work in Safari.  These sources can be local or remote video sources, so feel free to use your own! In addition to this, we added a div to the page with the id of "footnote" in order to later populate it with some data.

Next we are going to need to write some JavaScript in order to create our first Popcorn instance.  In this example we are going to write some inline JavaScript in the script tag but feel free to seperate everything out into its own file if you want to.  We are going to want to, in this example, simply show some text at 2 seconds in the video.  To do so add the following code ( again, building on our previous example ):

{% highlight html linenos %}
  <html>
    <head>
      <script src="http://popcornjs.org/code/dist/popcorn-complete.js"></script>
      <script>
        document.addEventListener( "DOMContentLoaded", function() {

          var popcorn = Popcorn( "#ourvideo" );

          popcorn.footnote({
            start: 2,
            end: 5,
            target: "footnote",
            text: "Pop!"
          });
        }, false );
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <video height="180" width="300" id="ourvideo">
        <source src="http://videos.mozilla.org/serv/webmademovies/popcornplug.mp4">
        <source src="http://videos.mozilla.org/serv/webmademovies/popcornplug.ogv">
        <source src="http://videos.mozilla.org/serv/webmademovies/popcornplug.webm">
      </video>
      <div id="footnote"></div>
    </body>
  </html>
{% endhighlight %}

First we create our script tag and add an event listener to the document that will execute the code within when it is ready to do so.  Next we created a variable to store our Popcorn instance in, called popcorn, and created our instance using the Popcorn constructor. The Popcorn constructor takes 1 arguement in this case, the id of our video.  This lets Popcorn know what video we are going to be using. Next we use the footnote plugin to add some text to an area on the page.  The footnote plugin is the simplest Popcorn plugin, which simply shows some text between a start and end point in a video.  In this example we start at 2 seconds and end at 5 seconds.  We specify a target, which lets Popcorn know which part of the page we will be putting the text into, which is in this case the footnote div.  We then specify some text which will be shown, which is "Pop!".

That's it! We have created our first instance and used the footnote plugin to display some text at a given time in our video.  For a live example of this work [take a look here](http://dev.popcornjs.org/popcorndocs/index.html).  We also have introuction videos for [YouTube](http://dev.popcornjs.org/popcorndocs/youtube.html), [Vimeo](http://dev.popcornjs.org/popcorndocs/vimeo.html), and how to use the [GoogleMaps plugin](http://dev.popcornjs.org/popcorndocs/googlemaps.html). Keep in mind, both YouTube and Vimeo need to be run from a web server.

As you can see, creating you first Popcorn instance is a painless experience, requiring about 7 lines of JavaScript to get it done.  For those of you who are not comfortable with HTML and JavaScript, our visual authoring tool for Popcorn, called [Popcorn-Maker](http://mozillapopcorn.org/popcorn-maker/), may be great alternative to check out.
